# Automated-Resume-Shortlisting

Automated Resume Shortlisting Web App (Flask, NLP, pdfminer): Developed and deployed an innovative web application utilizing Flask, pdfminer, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate the resume shortlisting process. Engineered a sophisticated algorithm employing tfidfvectorization and Truncated SVD for feature extraction, enhancing the precision of resume analysis. Implemented a CGPA filter feature, allowing the system to consider only resumes with a CGPA of 8 and above, streamlining the candidate selection process.

User-Friendly Interface with Manual Input (HTML, Flask): Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for the web application, allowing users to manually input resumes and job descriptions through a straightforward text box. Ensured an intuitive experience by integrating HTML elements and Flask for seamless data submission, enhancing accessibility for users with varying technical backgrounds.

Detailed Result Export to Excel (Excel, Sorting Algorithms): Engineered a result export system that generates a comprehensive Excel sheet with columns such as similarity score, phone number, email address, candidate details, skills, and CGPA. Implemented sorting algorithms to arrange results in descending order of similarity score, enabling quick identification of the most suitable candidates at the top and the least suitable at the bottom.

Advanced Data Processing with tfidfvectorization and Truncated SVD (Python, Machine Learning): Utilized advanced data processing techniques such as tfidfvectorization and Truncated SVD in Python to extract meaningful features from resumes and job descriptions. Enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of the shortlisting algorithm by employing machine learning principles, showcasing a commitment to leveraging technology for intelligent decision-making in the recruitment process.
